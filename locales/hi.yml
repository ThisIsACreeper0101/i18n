        <p>We're working diligently to make this the best RSS reader on the web and hope that you'll consider upgrading

        <p><strong>A free plan will also be available for users who have less than %{free_limit} subscriptions.</strong> While the free
        version does not include all the premium features, you can rest assured that all of the great features that are
        available today will be available going forward (and we'll add more free features along the way).</p>

        have <strong>%{current_count}</strong> subscriptions.</p>
